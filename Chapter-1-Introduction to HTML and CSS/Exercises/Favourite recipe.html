        <!-- The whole description of why the recipe is being shared -->
        <p>
            If you are in NEED of some of the most chocolate, fudgy and rich brownies 🍫, then this is the right place for you. 
            These are my go-to brownies made by my one and only my wife 💕. Whenever I want something fudgy, gooey, and dangerously delicious 😋, 
            you don’t need fancy or expensive ingredients, just a little time and a lot of love ❤️ which my wife uses every time, so I had to share the recipe. 
            ✨

        <!-- telling what the ingredients are -->
        <h2>This is all that will be needed for the Brownies 🍪</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup (40g) unsweetened cocoa powder 🍫 (Now this is the star of the show!)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter 🧈 (should be)</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar 🍬 (sweet just like her)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract 🍦 (for that comfy flavor)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs 🥚 (the eggs help keep it all together)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt 🧂 (of course, to balance the sweet part)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder (helps for the gentle lift)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (65g) all-purpose flour 🌾 — (enough to keep it all combined)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips or chunks 🍫 (this is optional but please do it for the best experience ever! 😍)</li>
        </ul>

        <!--step by step of the baking explained -->
        <h2>Now Let’s Make it with Love and Magic ✨</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, preheat your oven to 185°C (365°F) 🔥. Then, grab a small baking pan or tray and add parchment paper on it 📜.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter 🧈 slowly in the microwave or use a saucepan, then pour it into a mixing bowl 🥣.</li>
            <li>Add in the sugar 🍬, eggs 🥚, and vanilla 🍦 all one by one, and keep stirring it together well until it looks glossy and very smooth 🥄.</li>
            <li>Now, mix in the cocoa powder 🍫, flour 🌾, salt 🧂, and baking powder 🧁—just mix until it all comes together and don’t worry about anything else because it's all simple 👌.</li>
            <li>Add in those chocolate chips 🍫 of whatever is your personal favorite brand, mine is Hershey’s if you’re using them (PLEASE USE THEM 😋).</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into your tray or pan 🍰 and smooth out the top. You wanna lick it, don't you? 😜</li>
            <li>Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes ⏲️, and now you have to let it set for about 5 minutes because the heat of the brownie will cook and settle eventually 🔥.</li>
            <li>Okay, time to cut them into squares 🍫, grab a fork 🍴 (or use your hand, which is what I do 😆), and dig in. You deserve this! 😋</li>
        </ol>
